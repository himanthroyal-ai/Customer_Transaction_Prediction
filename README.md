# Customer Transaction Prediction – Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Customer Transaction Prediction** repository!
This project uses machine learning to identify which customers are most likely to make a **future transaction**, based on anonymized historical behavioural data.
Designed in the same format as your earlier project , this repository highlights practical predictive-modeling skills used in real-world business applications.


# Project Requirements

### Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning)

#### **Objective**

Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will perform a specific transaction in the future—regardless of transaction amount.

---

### **Specifications**

* **Dataset**: Anonymized customer attributes (no column names disclosed).
* **Data Preprocessing**:

  * Handling missing values
  * Exploratory analysis
  * Feature scaling / transformation
* **Model Development**:

  * Train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
  * Hyperparameter tuning
  * Evaluate metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
* **Output**:

  * Identify high-probability customers for targeted marketing
* **Documentation**:

  * Beginner-friendly explanations of techniques used


# Machine Learning: Analytics & Modeling

### **Objective**

Generate meaningful insights and accurate predictions about:

* Customer likelihood of making a transaction
* High-value customers
* Behavioral indicators influencing the prediction

These insights help businesses optimize marketing efforts, reduce customer churn, and improve campaign ROI.


# Model Workflow

1. Understand and preprocess anonymized dataset
2. Identify important predictive features
3. Train & compare multiple ML models
4. Evaluate performance with classification metrics
5. Select best model for deployment


# Key Insights

* Some anonymized features show strong predictive power
* Model successfully identifies customers with higher transaction probability
* Businesses can use predictions for targeted promotional strategies
